## Fun fact about me

The process of learning a language from childhood to the present.<br>
```
Visual Basic -> Assembly Language -> C++ -> Python -> JavaScript (Current)
```
I don't know why and I want to ask why I studied like this in the past, but fortunately because of hobby in the past, I was able to easily understand algorithms while learning JavaScript.
