# Hi, I'm Sunil Park ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End developer based in New Jersey.<br><br>
I have been coding as a hobby since I was young. Now, I have dedicated myself to studying and becoming a front-end developer, and I am <b>currently looking for entry-level front-end</b> positions. My current goal is to learn and gain more knowledge while working in the field.<br><br>
If given a task, no matter how challenging the process or how much work it requires, I take responsibility and strive to complete the project perfectly. It is not only my strongest asset but also my obligation.<br><br>
Since coding is both a hobby and a passion for me, I enjoy studying and learning about coding.
