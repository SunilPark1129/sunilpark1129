# Hi, I'm Sunil Park ðŸ‘‹

Passionate software engineer with expertise in frontend development and full-stack capabilities. Graduated from Rutgers University - New Brunswick, majored in Information Technology; 3 years of experience in frontend development.<br />

I have had a passion for coding since I was young and began learning it independently. While attending university, I took coding classes to deepen my knowledge. After graduating, I continued to self-study and focused on web development. I am deeply passionate about coding and consistently seek creative solutions for better web performance.<br />

As an experienced frontend developer with full-stack potential, I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Next.js, SCSS, Styled-Components, TailwindCSS, MUI, REST, Redux, React Query, Recoil, Zustand, TypeScript, Jest, JSDoc, Node.js, Git, GitHub, Figma, Three.js, R3F, Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, Render.<br />

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in crafting responsive web designs, transforming wireframes and design mockups into seamless UI components, and optimizing web performance for enhanced user experiences. Additionally, I excel at problem-solving, quickly picking up new skills, and contributing to both frontend and backend development.<br />

## New Hobby ðŸ˜„ðŸŒ±

- Iâ€™m deeply passionate about creating a wide variety of apps using AI APIs these days!
- Creating songs with AI. I've also created an audio player website for my songs: [https://sp-song.netlify.app/](https://sp-song.netlify.app/)<br />You can control playback with these keyboard shortcuts: 'p' to pause/start, 'arrow left/right' to skip tracks, 'arrow up/down' to adjust volume, and 'm' to mute. These controls also work if you're playing the songs in your car using the car audio player's buttons.
- I challenge myself to create the clone UI and landing page by participating in the daily challenges provided by iCodeThis website: [LINK](https://icodethis.com/Sunil)
- I've developed a hobby of trying out various things on Figma.
